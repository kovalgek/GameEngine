## About The Project

Parelhoen is a guineafowl in Dutch. These birds are super cool and come from Africa. I remember this one guineafowl that broke out of the farm and hung out in a parking lot. During the crazy times of COVID, this bird always put a smile on my face. So, I decided to name my game engine after it as a nod to its awesomeness. Long live Parelhoen, the brave little bird that brightened up my days!
